# Portfolio - Chris Smart

## Description

This website is a personal portfolio where you'll find a collection of my projects and creations showcasing my journey in the world of Web Development.

The purpose of this project is to store a collection of work to show potential employers and to utilise during my transition into a career in tech. It will be an ongoing project that I will adapt as I progress and learn new methods and tools.

It was great fun to build this website as it cemented a lot of the key concepts I have learned so far in the course, utilising HTML, CSS and Media Queries.

The website features a homepage with a basic bio, how to contact me section and external links to some of my current deployed projects.
